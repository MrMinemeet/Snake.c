# Snake.c üêç
This repository contains a simple implementation of the game *Snake* with a CLI.

It doesn't contain any fancy bells and whistles, but does the job.

## Why?
I recently handed in my Master Thesis "*A Generic Machine Code Instrumentation*" for the [Adolf-Adam-Informatikpreis](https://informatik.jku.at/teaching/adam_award/).
There the goal is to present the performances created by the Computer Science Alumni Students of Linz to a broader spectrum.
The target audience are students from Upper Austria.

The time for such a presentation is limited to around 10 minutes. Therefore, my goal is to bring the idea and success closer by instrumenting this game.
I'd like to showcase:
* reading values from the instrumented functions
* modifying values to alter the game
